gldpy is Python package that implements  tools for using Generalized Lambda Distribution (GLD) of three different parameterization types.

GLD is flexible family of continuous probability distribution with wide variety of density shapes under one functional form. It specified by four parameters which determine location, scale and shape (skewness and kurtosis) of the distribution.

GLD is easily described in terms of quantile function which makes it easy to use in simulation studies. 

It can approximate a lot of well-known distributions such as normal, uniform, exponential, Student's, gamma, some of beta distributions and many others. 

GLD shapes can be symmetric or asymmetric  and have different combination of finite and infinite tails, they include unimodal, U-shaped, J-shaped and monotone density functions. So it is particularly useful tool for data fitting applications.
